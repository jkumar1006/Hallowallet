4. **Click "Should I Buy This? 🤔"**

### Step 4: Review the Recommendation

The system will analyze and show:

#### ✅ **BUY** (Green) - You Can Afford It
```
Example:
Income: $5,000/month
Savings Goal: $1,000/month
Current Spending: $2,000
Item: Coffee Maker ($150)

Result: ✅ Go Ahead! You Can Afford It

Reason: "You can afford this! After this purchase, you'll 
still have $1,850 remaining this month, which is 46% of 
your monthly budget. Your savings goal remains on track."

Impact on Monthly Savings: $1,850 remaining
After Purchase Balance: $1,850
```

#### ⏳ **WAIT** (Yellow) - Consider Waiting
```
Example:
Income: $3,000/month
Savings Goal: $1,000/month
Current Spending: $1,500
Item: Laptop ($800)

Result: ⏳ Consider Waiting

Reason: "This purchase is possible but will leave you with 
only $200 for the rest of the month. Consider waiting until 
next month or checking out these cheaper alternatives."

Impact on Monthly Savings: $200 remaining
After Purchase Balance: $200

1. Lenovo IdeaPad 3 - $320 [View on Amazon]
2. HP Pavilion 15 - $400 [View on Amazon]

Savings Goal: $1,500/month
Current Spending: $2,400
Item: iPhone 15 ($999)

Result: ❌ Not Recommended Right Now

Reason: "This purchase would exceed your monthly budget by 
$399. It would impact your savings goal of $18,000. I 
strongly recommend postponing this purchase or exploring 
these budget-friendly alternatives."
